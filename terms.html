                2. LIMITED USER
            </h3>
            <p>
                1. The User agrees that given the nature of the Internet, even though the Website is targeted to Indian
                residents only, it may be accessed in other parts of the world. If the User is not an Indian resident
                and yet uses the Website, User acknowledges, understands and agrees that User is doing so on its own
                initiative and at its own risk and that it is User’s responsibility (and not Kirana Friends’
                responsibility) to make sure that User’s use of the Website complies with all applicable local laws. If
                the User is not an Indian resident, by using this Website and/or submitting his personally identifiable
                information or any other information on the Website, User expressly consents to the transfer of such
                data to India, and to the processing of such data on Kirana Friends’ Indian servers, where his data will
                be governed by Indian laws that may provide a level of data protection different than User’s country.
                2. The User agrees and undertakes not to sell, trade or resell or exploit for any commercial purposes,
                any portion of the Services. For the removal of doubt, it is clarified that the Website is for close
                user group and a discovery/information platform. KIRANA FRIENDS shall in no event be considered as
                ‘service provider’ to the User. The Website is not for commercial use but is specifically meant for
                personal use only of the User.
                3. The User further agrees and undertakes not to reverse engineer, modify, copy, distribute, transmit,
                display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell any
                information, software, products, services or intellectual property obtained from the Website in any
                manner whatsoever. Limited reproduction and copying of the content of the Website is permitted provided
                that the prior written consent of KIRANA FRIENDS has been obtained. For the removal of doubt, it is
                clarified that unlimited or wholesale reproduction, copying of the content for commercial or non-
                commercial purposes and unwarranted modification of data and information within the content of the
                Website is strictly not permitted.

                2. Although KIRANA FRIENDS makes commercial efforts, reasonable or otherwise to ensure that the
                description and content of the information displayed or communicated to the User on each page of the

                information.

                unauthorized access to or alteration of the User's transmissions or data; (d) any other matter relating
                to the Services; including, without limitation, damages for loss of use, data or profits, arising out of
                or in any way connected with availing of the Services through the Website.
                6. Neither shall KIRANA FRIENDS be responsible for the delay or inability to use the Website or the
                Services, the provision of or failure to provide the Services, or for any information, software,
                products, services and related graphics obtained from KIRANA FRIENDS through the Website, whether based
                on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise. Further, KIRANA FRIENDS shall not be held
                responsible for non-availability of the Website during periodic maintenance operations or any unplanned
                suspension of access to the Website and/ or the Services that may occur due to technical reasons or for
                any other reason whatsoever. The User understands and agrees that any material and/or data downloaded or
                otherwise obtained from KIRANA FRIENDS through the Website is done entirely at User’s discretion and

                that results from such material and/or data.
                7. These limitations, disclaimer of warranties and exclusions apply without regard to whether the
                damages arise from (a) breach of contract, (b) breach of warranty, (c) negligence, or (d) any other
                cause of action, to the extent such exclusion and limitations are not prohibited by applicable law.
